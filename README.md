# weather-dashboard

## Description

This is the weather dashboard for challenge 6. It is a simple weather application that provides accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts and conditions. With this user-friendly design, this application will allow the user to easily track the weather for cities around the world including current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. This application was made for users who are looking for a straightforward weather app that helps them stay informed and plan out their day, week, or even travel plans.

However, when the user types a city in the designated search bar, the current weather for that city will be displayed beside it. Also, they will see a 5 day forecast for the current city.

As the user keeps typing cities, these will appear in the search history (saved in the localStorage), and the user can go back to any past city they typed and see the weather dashboard once again.

Lastly, the user will also be able to clear the search history if wanted, this will make all the searched cities get erased from the history and localStorage.
